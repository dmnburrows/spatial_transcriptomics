# spatial_transcriptomics
This repo contains code for analysing spatial transcriptomic data and applying probabilistic modelling to understand cell type expression in such data. 

## What does this repo contain?
Modules contain functions for analysing and modelling spatial transcriptomic data.
Accompanying ipynotebooks demonstrate how to use the modules.

Modules
'admin_functions.py' - useful administrative functions useful

'cell_decomp_func.py' - module for inferring proportions of cell types from mixed spatial transcriptomic datasets via probabilistic modelling.

Notebooks
'cell_decomp.ipynb' - notebooks for inferring proportions of cell types from mixed spatial transcriptomic datasets via probabilistic modelling.
